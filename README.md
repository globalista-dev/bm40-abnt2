BM40 ABNT2-based QMK keymap

This is a simple BM40 keymap that's optimized and made with the Brazilian ABNT2 layout in mind.

It uses QMK and was based on the default keymap available when using QMK MSYS.

You can download the keymap.c file, edit it (or not) and build it yourself.

Alternatively, you might want to download the .hex file and flash it using QMK Toolbox.

Do note that I am NOT responsible for anything you do with these files. This is not a tutorial. Please read on how to use, build and flash with QMK. Here is a comprehensive guide: https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/
