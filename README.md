# BM40-ABNT2
BM40 ABNT2-based QMK keymap

This is a simple BM40 keymap that's optimized and made with the Brazilian ABNT2 layout in mind.

It uses QMK and was based on the available default keymap.

You can download the keymap.c file, edit it (or not) and build it yourself. This is recommended.

Alternatively, you might want to download the .hex file and flash it using QMK Toolbox. I highly advise against doing this, as you cannot customize the layout to your liking.

Do note that I am NOT responsible for anything you do with these files. This is not a tutorial. Do not try to flash this on a board other than BM40 from KPRepublic. 

Please read on how to use, build and flash with QMK. Here is a comprehensive guide: https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/
